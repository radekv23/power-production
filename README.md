# Power Production Project for *Fundamentals of Data Analysis* at GMIT
by Radek Wojtczak G00352936<br>


<br>
Instructions:

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set.
